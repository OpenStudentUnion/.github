# Welcome to OpenSU

Hi ðŸ‘‹

We're leading the digital revolution in Student Union management and experience.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

OpenSU is a BYOF (bring your own frontend) solution, giving you the highest degree of flexibility and tailoring when creating your SU's digital system.
Our backend solution is entirely contained within Directus, with extensions that add heaps of features designed to help manage your Student Union.
Our sample frontends are made with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), but you can use any framework or tooling, just check out our API reference (coming soon).
